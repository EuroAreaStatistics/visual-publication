In the early days, it usually took the form of commodity money – an object made from something that had its own market value, such as coins made from gold. Later, commodity money was replaced by representative money, such as banknotes, that could be swapped for a certain fixed amount of gold or silver. Modern economies, including the euro area, are based on fiat money. This is money that is declared legal tender and issued by a central bank. Rather than relying on a substance or commodity, such as gold, to provide its underlying value, fiat money is widely accepted because people trust the central bank to keep the value of money stable over time.</p>\r\n<h4>1.1.1 Euro banknotes and coins</h4>\r\n<p>The legal tender of the euro area is the euro. More than 342 million people use it as the single currency in the 19 EU Member States comprising the euro area. This makes the euro a tangible symbol of European integration.</p>\r\n<p>Legally, euro banknotes are issued by the Eurosystem, which is made up of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the euro area countries. In practice, however, it is only the national central banks that actually issue euro banknotes and withdraw them from circulation. The ECB does not have a cash office. The legal issuers of euro coins are the national governments of euro area countries.</p>\r\n<p>After they have been issued, banknotes enter into circulation by being supplied over the counter by banks or via cash dispensers. Unless they are kept as a store of value, they are used for payments, returned to banks and recirculated until they become unfit (damaged or worn), at which point they are withdrawn from circulation by the national central banks.</p>\r\n<p>Further information about euro banknotes and coins is available in the euro section of the ECB’s <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html\">website</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>1.1.2 Banknote and coin statistics</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=9691111\">Statistics about euro banknote and coin circulation</a> are produced on a monthly basis and can be found in the ECB’s Statistical Data Warehouse.</p>\r\n<p>Low and medium-value notes (€5, €10, €20 and €50) are mostly used for day-to-day payments.

They are typically held on current accounts and used for cashless payments.</p>\r\n<p>Other, slightly less liquid (readily available), types of deposit that are also considered to be money are savings deposits that can be paid out within three months following advance notification, as well as time deposits that have an agreed maturity of up to two years.</p>\r\n<p>Longer-term deposits with a maturity of over two years, or savings deposits redeemable at notice with a notice period of over three months, are not considered to be money because they are rather less liquid and cannot be quickly converted into cash or transferred.</p>\r\n<h4>Interest rates</h4>\r\n<p>Deposits normally earn interest, which the bank pays to depositors for holding their money. Typically, the longer the bank can hold a deposit before returning it to the depositor, the higher the interest rate on that deposit will be.

Central banks therefore monitor growth in money volumes in order to cross-check identified risks to price stability. To this end, the Eurosystem has defined different measures of money – known as monetary aggregates. These aggregates are derived from the balance sheet of entities that the Eurosystem calls “monetary financial institutions”, or MFIs, which consist of central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions and funds that receive deposits, such as money market funds.</p>\r\n<h4>1.3.1 Monetary aggregates</h4>\r\n<p>Monetary aggregates are defined in terms of the liquidity of assets – i.e. how quickly and easily an asset can be converted into cash or used to make payments.</p>\r\n<p>The narrowest and most liquid measure of money is M1, which comprises banknotes and coins in circulation and overnight deposits.</p>\r\n<p>The broader aggregate M2 contains M1 as well as deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years, or those redeemable at notice with a notice period of up to three months.</p>\r\n<p>The broadest monetary aggregate is M3.

It does so by issuing banknotes and providing liquidity (lending money) to banks, and by setting the “key” interest rates. This enables it to influence money market conditions and steer short-term interest rates. These rates and conditions are then passed on to the wider economy where they affect the volumes of, and interest rates on, loans to companies and households and, ultimately, the price level.

Traditionally the most important instruments are the official interest rates, also known as the policy rates. In the Eurosystem, the three key ECB interest rates are: (1) the rate on the main refinancing operations, which determines the interest rate applied in the regular lending operations conducted by the Eurosystem to provide liquidity to the banking system; (2) the deposit rate, which is the rate banks receive for depositing money overnight with the Eurosystem; and (3) the rate on the marginal lending facility, which determines the interest rate on overnight credit provided by the Eurosystem to banks.

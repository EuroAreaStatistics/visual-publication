    "<p>When we think of money, we generally think of cash in our wallet, the balance of our bank account or the payments we make. But what does money do in the economy, and what does money mean for central banks?</p>\r\n<p>Money serves three different functions in the economy: (1) it is a medium of exchange with a value that is trusted by everyone, (2) it is a unit of account that enables prices to be set for goods and services, and (3) it is a store of value that can be saved for later use.</p>\r\n<p>In central bank statistics, broadly speaking, money is composed of cash in circulation and deposits.</p>\r\n<p>The next two sections provide a brief explanation of cash and deposits and present related statistics produced by the ECB. The third section describes how the ECB measures the amount of money in the euro area economy using \u201cmonetary aggregates\u201d.</p>",

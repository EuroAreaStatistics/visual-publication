    '<p class="MsoNormal">We all care about the prices of the goods and services that we buy. It also matters to us how much prices change over time. And the economy tends to work best when prices are relatively stable. Inflation is at the heart of these issues. But what is it exactly? And what are the reasons for differences in inflation rates across countries and over time?</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">The next three sections try to answer these questions. Section 1.1 introduces the concept of inflation, Section 1.2 explains cross-country differences in inflation rates and Section 1.3 looks at inflation over time. Each section includes interactive charts that allow you to learn more about inflation statistics.</p>',

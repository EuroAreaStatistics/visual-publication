  text: `<p>Banks are the main providers of financing to households when they need to borrow funds. This lending is classified according to the purpose for which it is granted, such as for house purchase (to buy homes) or for consumption (to buy goods and services). It usually takes the form of a bank loan.</p>\r
<p>For example, households typically do not have enough capital to purchase property outright. This means that they rely on a bank or a mortgage bank to lend them the money. Loans for house purchase are usually secured against the property that is being purchased, or other forms of guarantee. The interest rates on bank loans influence household spending and investment decisions.</p>\r
<p>The ECB collects data on the amounts of bank loans to households and the respective interest rates. These statistics provide a picture of financial conditions for households. A key indicator is the overall cost of borrowing for house purchase, which is based on the volumes of, and interest rates on, all loans for house purchase in a given country. These and other loan data are used to analyse monetary developments and the effects of monetary policy, as well as to monitor financial stability.</p>\r
